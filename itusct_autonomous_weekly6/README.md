# Restaurant Bot

## Overview
The Restaurant Bot is a sophisticated terminal-based application developed as an assignment for the Istanbul Technical University's ITU ZES Solar Car Team. This project exemplifies the practical application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in C++, particularly focusing on encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, all within the context of a user-interactive command-line interface (CLI). The primary function of this bot is to aid users in assembling personalized meal plans based on individual taste preferences and dietary requirements, streamlining the process of menu selection with an intuitive, dialogue-based system.

## Features
- **User Information Input**: Captures essential details such as the user's name, surname, and preferred title, enhancing personalized interaction throughout the meal selection process.
- **Menu Customization**: Provides a comprehensive selection of dishes including starters, salads, main courses, drinks, appetizers, and desserts, enabling users to compile a customized menu suited to their personal tastes and dietary needs.
- **Taste Balance**: Empowers users to articulate their taste preferences across five dimensions: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and savory. The application utilizes these preferences to recommend dishes that align with the userâ€™s unique taste profile.
- **Menu Suggestions**: Utilizes an intelligent suggestion mechanism that proposes individual dishes or a complete menu tailored to the user's specified taste preferences, significantly simplifying the decision-making process.
- **Price Calculation**: Dynamically calculates the total price of selected menu items, factoring in any additional customization options such as extra toppings or dietary adjustments (e.g., vegan options).
- **Menu Approval**: Allows users to review their final selections and make any necessary adjustments before finalizing their menu, ensuring complete satisfaction with the chosen meal plan.
